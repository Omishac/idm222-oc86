            <h1>MeiMei Re-design</h1>

            <h3>MeiMei's Mission:</h3>
            <p>MeiMei is an Asian Fusion Restuarant that opened up in 2019 right here in Old City, Philadelphia. The owner,Hsiang Ho, also known as Jay. Is a first generation Asian American who is originally from Taipei, Taiwan. 
                His whole family has been in the restaurant industry for over 30 hard and blessed years. In the fall of 2019 he followed his dreams of starting his own restaurant in the city, and then started the Restaurant MeiMei.</p>
             <h3>Designer role:</h3>
             <p>In this project for my User Interface Design II class, the purpose of the project was to choose a website to redesign. I chose MeiMei and throughout this process I did a complete flip of the website to make the site fit the aesthetic from the restaurant as well as have a more sleek design.</p>
